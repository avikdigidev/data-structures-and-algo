* Below we will define an n-interesting polygon.
* Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1.
* An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1 interesting polygon and
* appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side.
* You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.



Example
For n = 2, the output should be
solution(n) = 5;
For n = 3, the output should be
solution(n) = 13.
Input/Output
[execution time limit] 3 seconds (java)
[input] integer n
Guaranteed constraints:
1 â‰¤ n < 104.
[output] integer
The area of the n-interesting polygon.
